This is a simple expense tracker app.  You can login and register (authentication using express session
and cookies), then you are directed to the dashboard page. From here you can create new expenses with
description, dates, and amounts. Delete expenses by simply clicking the [X] next to the listed expense.
Clicking update next to expense pulls up an update menu to change expense details. Additionally, images
linking to money management websites are listed at the bottom of the dashboard. One can move click the
user settings at the top of the navbar to change their username or password.
